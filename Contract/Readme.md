# Decentralized Donation System

## 🧾 Project Description
The **Decentralized Donation System** is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to donate funds securely and transparently to a project or cause. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and immutability.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To build a transparent, trustless donation ecosystem where every contribution can be tracked, verified, and utilized efficiently without intermediaries.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Secure Donations**: Contributors can donate directly to the project wallet using Ethereum.
- **Transparency**: Every donation is recorded on the blockchain and publicly viewable.
- **Owner Control**: Only the project owner can withdraw funds to ensure accountability.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Add multi-cause donation tracking (donate to specific causes).
- Introduce reward tokens for donors.
- Enable DAO governance for fund allocation.
- Integrate real-time dashboards using web3.js.
